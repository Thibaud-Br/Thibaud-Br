# Hi ![](waving_hand.gif)  
My name is Thibaud and I'm a Nantes based front-end developer. I recently fell in love with front-end development and I'm currently spending all my time learning new languages and creating beautiful websites.  
My goal is to become a professional front-end developer and turn my passion into my job.
## Languages and tools that I use
HTML / CSS / SASS / JS / React (just started learning it)  
Github / VSCode / NPM
